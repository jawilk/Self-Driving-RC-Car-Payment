## Final

## Training
For training the model a combination of own images and images from the german traffic sign dataset were used (see "Sources" below). The model was trained with 6 classes:
* 0 Background
* 1 50 km/h
* 2 Priority
* 3 Stop
* 4 Dangerous Curve Right
* 5 No Passing
*

## Extraction of region proposals
A sliding window approach was used to extract regions of interest.
